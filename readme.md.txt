Python Functions & Modules Assignment
This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of functions and modules in Python programming.
Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
The task1_factorial.py script demonstrates:

Calculating the factorial of a number using both iterative and recursive approaches
Proper function definition with documentation
Error handling for edge cases

Features:

Implementation of factorial calculation using a loop (iterative approach)
Implementation of factorial calculation using recursion (recursive approach)
Edge case handling (negative numbers, zero)
User input option to try different numbers

Example:
CopyFactorial of 5 (iterative): 120
Factorial of 5 (recursive): 120

Enter a number to calculate its factorial: 7
Factorial of 7: 5040
Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
The task2_math_module.py script demonstrates:

Using Python's built-in math module to perform various calculations
Taking user input and validating it
Calculating and displaying results in a formatted way

Calculations performed:

Square root
Natural logarithm (base e)
Sine (in radians)
Additional calculations: cosine, tangent, ceiling, and floor

Example:
CopyEnter a number for mathematical calculations: 25

========================================
Math Calculations for 25.0
========================================
Square Root: 5.0000
Natural Logarithm: 3.2189
Sine (radians): -0.1324
Cosine (radians): 0.9912
Tangent (radians): -0.1335
Ceiling: 25, Floor: 25
========================================
How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system
Download or clone this repository
Run the scripts using:

Copypython task1_factorial.py
python task2_math_module.py
Error Handling
Both scripts include error handling to manage:

Invalid user input
Mathematical constraints (like logarithm of non-positive numbers)
General exceptions to prevent program crashes

Dependencies
These scripts use only the Python standard library and have no external dependencies.
